This repo includes a test scenario that mirrors the Hoodie end-user-experience from install & setup to first run. It exists to ensure that Hoodie is usable at all times by all users.

Tests can be run on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) and/or locally.

```js
require('hoodie-integration-test')();
```

That's all (:
